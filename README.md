# Chroma Theme

This is a color theme heavily inspired in [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme), modified to make code easier to understand. Colors don't just look nice, they also make sense:

Variables in white-yellow, classes and types in orange, functions in blue, strings, characters and numbers in red, keywords in purple.

## Sample
Some swift code using Chroma Dark. Looks great on Objective-C too!
