# Chroma Theme

This is a color theme inspired in [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme), modified to make your code easier to understand. Colors don't just look nice, they also make sense.

The color scheme has been chosen so what is the most relevant for understanding your code at a glance is the easiest to distinguish.

Comments blend into the background.

Anything declared in your project has a slightly more vibrant color.

Variable names, classes, functions, keywords... all of them have very different colors helping with the legibility of your code:

Variables: locals are ![white](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/white.png), instances declared in the project are ![yellow](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/yellow.png), others are ![light yellow](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_yellow.png).

Functions: those declared in the project are ![orange](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/orange.png), others are ![light orange](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_orange.png).

Classes and types: those declared in the project are ![blue](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/blue.png), others are ![light blue](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_blue.png).

Keywords are ![purple](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/purple.png).
