# Chroma Theme

This is a color theme inspired in [Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme), modified to make your code easier to understand. Colors don't just look nice, they also make sense.

The color scheme has been chosen so what is more important (like variable names and function calls) is easier to distinguish from the background. Each color has a purpose:

Variables: locals are ![white](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/white.png), instance variables declared in the project are ![light yellow](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_yellow.png), other instance variables are ![yellow](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/yellow.png).

Functions: those declared in the project are ![light orange](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_orange.png), others are ![orange](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/orange.png).

Classes and types: those declared in the project are ![light blue](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/light_blue.png), others are ![blue](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/blue.png).

Keywords are ![purple](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/purple.png).

Strings are ![red](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/red.png), characters and numbers are ![green](https://github.com/danielb5/chroma-theme/raw/master/images/green.png).



## Dark version
Some swift code using Chroma theme. Looks great on Objective-C too!

## Light version
Here the same example using the light version. It uses a similar color palette, but inverted (darker colors go to project elements, lighter colors go to library elements).
